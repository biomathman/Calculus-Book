            <p><b>Fancy-pants calculus books are easy to find.</b> There are so
            many it's a wonder that we aren't drowning under the crush. There
            are three times as many "math" listing on Amazon as there are "sex"
            listings. This may be because nearly a million American college
            students are expected to shell out some $200 annually to purchase
            these doorstops that they never even crack open.</p>

            <p><b>"Doing Calculus” is a giant step backwards in publishing.</b>
            It doesn't have any bells and whistles. Unlike those those other
            calculus books, the ones with gee-whiz animations that rattle your
            teeth and on-line assessment tools that blink and flash and pop
            your cerebellar networks into a seemingly catatonic overload, it's
            just ink on paper. Or you can go for the <b>DRM-free PDF file</b>.
            With lots of snarky comments hidden between the lines. And cool
            pictures.</p>

        <td colspan="2"><p>Sure, it comes with a web page (in fact you're looking at it
            right now), but there's virtually nothing useful on the web page,
            so it is unlikely to drive you nuts. And equally unlikely to crash
            your computer. Calculus might drive you bonkers, but the web page
            is unlikely to do more than mildly amuse you.</p>

            <p><b>"Doing Calculus" is not just another doorstop.</b> It's a
            cheaper doorstop. It's a better looking doorstop. Though the
            paperback is thin enough that you might actually be able to cram it
            under some doors. Depends on the door. If you go for the PDF,
            you'll have to print out a lot of pages and use <b>really big
            staples</b> to turn it into a door stop.</p></td>
